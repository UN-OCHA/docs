# UNOCHA Shared Developer Documentation

| Audience |
| :------- |
| Everyone |

This repo contains documentation that is common to many projects. To avoid duplicating the instructions or commands across repos or Handbook documents, we keep them up to date in one central location.

Browse the repository and view README files on GitHub. Each section should contain info about the audience or technical details. This very page contains an example at the top.
